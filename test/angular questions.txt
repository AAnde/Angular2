Scenario based questions, basic theory, rest apis, factory   , services, http calls etc. 

difference between .factory() and service()

Both .service() and .factory() are both singletons as you’ll only get one instance of each Service regardless of what API created it.

Remember that .service() is just a Constructor, it’s called with new, whereas .factory() is just a function that returns a value.

Using .factory() gives us much more power and flexibility, whereas a .service() is essentially the “end result” of a .factory() call. The .service() gives us the returned value by calling new on the function, which can be limiting, whereas a .factory() is one-step before this compile process as we get to choose which pattern to implement and return.
